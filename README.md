# teamgenerator
Team Generator is a tool that allows the user to generate competitive teams for a friendly match

The project is in a very early phase and is not very versatile yet.

Currently, it's designed to support 2 teams of 5 players. The exceeding players get a bench to sit while they wait for a spot in the game.

In the future, there will be support for more sports (that do not require exactly 5 players on each), different category of players (for instance, goalkeepers).

# Origin
This project was born in a software company located in Sorocaba, Brazil, when the members of a project decided to exercise a little bit and play a weekly soccer.

Being developers, they decided to develop a tool to randomize the teams using the ability of each player as a way to keep the matches competitive and entertaining.
